                Subhash Chandra Bose, popularly known as Netaji, was a great militant, freedom fighter and a patriot. He was born in Cuttack, Orissa on 23rd January 1897 to Janakinath Bose and Prabhavati Devi. His father Janakinath Bose was a well-known lawyer of his time. His mother Prabhavati Devi was a religious woman. 
ubhash Chandra was a brilliant student who had scored the second position in the matriculation exam. At an early age, he started reading about Swami Vivekananda and Ramakrishna and was influenced by their teachings. Bose completed his B.A. Hons in Philosophy in 1918 from the University of Calcutta. He later went to England in September 1919 for further studies. He was selected for the Indian Civil Service but he did not want to stay in England and serve the British government. Subhash Chandra resigned from his Civil Service job in 1921 and returned to India after hearing of the national turmoil in India. 
From a young age, Subhash Chandra Bose had the nationalist temperament and Britishers’ discrimination towards Indians would fill him with rage. To serve the country, he joined the Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party). Bose joined the Noncooperation Movement, started by Gandhi under his influence. Bose was a revolutionary freedom fighter who was known to have founded the Azad Hind Army or Indian National Army. For his revolutionary movements, Bose had been to jail several times. He was suspected of connections with secret revolutionary movements and was sent to Mandalay Jail in Burma (Myanmar) where he contracted Tuberculosis. Bose was elected the president of Congress party and worked along with Jawahar Lal Nehru, another great political leader. Both had a more militant and left-wing approach to Independence, which became a reason for Bose’s differences with Gandhi and other Congress leaders. "
